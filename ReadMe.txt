WaterTracker
An open-source daily watter tracker written completely in AutoItv3, with customizable hydration reminders.

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Download AutoIt if you don't already have it installed (11.7mb). You will need this to compile the code.
https://www.autoitscript.com/cgi-bin/getfile.pl?autoit3/autoit-v3-setup.exe

2. Be sure the .au3 file association is checked during installation.

3. Make sure you've unzipped WaterTracker. In the WaterTracker directory, right-click "WaterTracker.au3" and then "Compile Script"

4. Run WaterTracker.exe. If you wish to run the program from outside the program's directory, create a shortcut.

HOW TO USE:
This program keeps track of your water intake throughout the day. There are 3 ways to add water amounts:
- By clicking the 3 buttons (Labeled 16, 20, 32oz. by default)
- By typing in a custom amount under "Quick Add", and then clicking "Add"
- By dragging the slider to the amount you wish to add, and then clicking "Add"

You can set reminders to drink water by clicking "Reminders".
- Click "New" in the Reminders window, and enter the time you'd like the reminder to go off. Click "Add" to add the reminder.
- Up to 10 daily reminders can be added.
- 2 options are available for the reminder alerts. A sound to play, a popup, or both. If neither are selected, your reminders will essentially do nothing, so be sure to have at least 1 selected.

You can adjust some of the values in WaterTracker via Options
- Daily Goal is the total amount of water you're trying to drink each day.
- Logging Enabled will automatically log your progress in dailylogs.txt at 3:00AM, as long as the program's open.
- X minimizes to tray - checking this box will allow Water Tracker to minimize to tray when you click the X button, instead of closing the program. Keep in mind, clicking "Exit" will always exit the program no matter what.
- Custom values: These 3 input boxes will allow you to change the value in ounces of the 3 quickbuttons on the main program window.
- Always click "Save" to apply changes made. Clicking X will not save changes made in Options.

"Reset" will simply clear the day's data. Your options will not be afected.
